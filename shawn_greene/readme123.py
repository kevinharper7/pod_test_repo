temperature equations
C= (F-32) * 5/9
F= (C * 9/5) + 32
'''

# task 1: convert 100 F to C.

100= (x * 9/5) + 32

print(100= (x * 9/5) + 32) 
37.7 = x
x is a float
# this will be saved as celsius_100.

#task 2:convert 0F to C.
# the following is saved as celsius_0
0= (x * 9/5) +32
-17.7 = x
x is a float

#task 3: convert a temperature of 5 C to F.

the end result is 41 F degrees fahrenheit


30.2 degrees celsius is hotter than 85.1
