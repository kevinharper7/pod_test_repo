The Lakers went all in this offseason and swung a deal for former Pelicans forward Anthony Davis.
Those three have made good developments with the Pelicans, especially Brandon Ingram.
Los Angeles has ridden James and Davis, along with a supporting cast built around them, to the second-best record in the NBA.
They were narrowly behind the Bucks for the best record in the league.
